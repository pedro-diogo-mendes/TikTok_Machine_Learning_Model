Welcome to the TikTok Claims Classification Model Project!

This project is part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate Program in which we have 3 different projects that we can work with in order to finish the course.

I've chosen the TikTok Claims Classification Model Project, and this notebook shows my thought process. Goes through EDA (exploring and cleaning the dataset), regression analysis, and modeling a machine learning algorithm.
